# CollapsiblePanel Component in React

This project demonstrates how to create a versatile and reusable `CollapsiblePanel` component in React that allows users to toggle the visibility of its content. The component includes the following features:

- Clickable header/title section: Clicking this triggers the toggling of the content's visibility.
- Collapsible content section: This section should initially be hidden and smoothly expand/collapse on user interaction.
- Content customization: Allow passing content as a prop to display within the panel.
- Visual indicator: Use an icon or symbol in the header to indicate the current state (collapsed/expanded).
- Smooth animation: Implement a smooth animation during content expansion/collapse.
- Reusable: The component should be easily integrated into different parts of your application.
- Controllable behaviour: Parent components should be able to set the initial state (collapsed/expanded) and toggle it programmatically.
- Visually appealing: Apply basic styling for a good user experience.

## Project Structure

- `src/CollapsiblePanel.js`: The CollapsiblePanel component.
- `src/CollapsiblePanel.css`: CSS for the CollapsiblePanel component.
- `src/App.js`: Demonstrates usage of the CollapsiblePanel component.
- `src/index.js`: Entry point of the React application.
- `src/index.css`: Global styles for the application.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Start the application using `npm start`.

The `CollapsiblePanel` component can be easily integrated into different parts of your React application as demonstrated in `App.js`.
